						<h3>introduction</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>COVID-19 displays remarkable disparity of clinical symptoms</li>
							<li>CD4+ T cells are central organizers of anti-viral immune responses</li>
							<li>COVID-19 patients seem to develop robust Th1-like SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses focused on spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins (Grifoni et al., 2020)</li>
						</ul>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>introduction</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Increased frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are found in severe disease in some (Anft et al., 2020), but not in other studies (Braun et al., 2020).</li>
							<li>Several studies show that a significant fraction of un-exposed donors possess SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ memory T cells</li>
							<li>These memory T cells exhibit cross-reactivity against selected peptides with homology to related common cold corona virus (CCCoV)</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>introduction</h3>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>What types of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective and which are detrimental ?</li>
						<li>Does exaggerated or dysfunctional CD4+ T cell responses contribute to the observed hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients ?</li>
						<li>What are the factors determining the magnitude as well as the quality of the CD4+ T cell response and and how this relates to predisposition and/or manifestation of severe COVID-19?</li>
